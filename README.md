# Vault - OneGameAMonth - December 2013

## Overview
A basic guess-the-code game, based (rather distantly) on an old puzzle board
game.

## Dependencies

* [jaws - Javascript graphics library](https://github.com/ippa/jaws)

I've included the library in the src directory so that this project contains
the correct version of it, in case later versions introduce breaking changes
(though as it hasn't been updated recently, this seems unlikely).
